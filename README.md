# Overview
We have used various machine Learning Algorithms from Sklearn such as Dession Tree,Random Forest,Extra tree regression.
Our POC(proof of concepts) was to perdict rating of any restaurant based on features.

# Motivation
Sometime it become difficult to know about which restaurant is best in nearby and it become little confuse to measure best restaurant but using this ML app can help us to overcome problem.
Restaurant Rating project is for person who wants to know about good rated restaurent based on prices,facility of booking and online services and voting by visitor.
